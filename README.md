We replicated "Identifying Judicial Empathy: Does Having Daughters Cause Judges to Rule for Womenâ€™s Issues?" by Adam N. Glynn and Maya Sen.

The paper and associated replication data and code can be found at the below link:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26544/CVDFYK&version=2.1

Specifically, we replicated Tables 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9, as well as Figure 1.

In replicating table 9 we felt that, although separating the results by party was informative, it was also important to obtain overall data and so we added combined results to the right hand side of the data table. 

On this repo, you can find the .csv files used in the initial study, along with the replication code provided by the authors.

Additionally, you will find two .rmd files. The first, Replication1, is our official attempt to replicate the study.

The second, table2, was where a decent amount of our troubleshooting took place (and the file which was impacted by many of our commits).

Finally, there is our pdf file containing our replication work.
