We replicated "Identifying Judicial Empathy: Does Having Daughters Cause Judges to Rule for Womenâ€™s Issues?" by Adam N. Glynn and Maya Sen.

The paper and associated replication data and code can be found at the below link:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26544/CVDFYK&version=2.1

In Replication 1, we replicated Tables 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9, as well as Figure 1.

In Replication 2 (which we realize is just Replication 1 continued), we focused on Tables 7 and 9.

We recreated Table 7 using Stargazer and added an additional model focusing on female Republican judges.

In replicating table 9 we felt that, although separating the results by party was informative, it was also important to obtain overall data and so we added combined results to the right hand side of the data table. 

On this repo, you can find the .csv files used in the initial study, along with the replication code provided by the authors.

Additionally, you will find four .rmd files. The first, Replication1, is our first week's attempt to replicate the study.

The second, Replication2 is our second week's replication attempt.

The third, table2, was where a decent amount of our troubleshooting took place in week 1.

The fourth, table_7, was for troubleshooting in week 2.

Finally, there is our pdf file containing our replication work from the first week, and our html file containing our replication work from the second week.
