We replicated "Identifying Judicial Empathy: Does Having Daughters Cause Judges to Rule for Womenâ€™s Issues?" by Adam N. Glynn and Maya Sen.

Specifically, we replicated Tables 1, 2, 3, and 9, as well as Figure 1.

On this repo, you can find the csv files used in the initial study, along with the replication code provided by the authors.

Additionally, you will find two rmd files. The first, Replication1, is our official attempt to replicate the study.

The second, table2, was where a decent amount of our troubleshooting took place (and the file that many of our commits impacted).

Finally, there is our pdf file containing our replication work.
